# Web-Tech-Coursework-1
This is my Web Technologies SET08101 Submission for Coursework #1.

Through the use of HTML, CSS, and Javascript I was able to make an interactive website from scratch. Examples of lessons learned include section off items inside the browser window, allow buttons/cursor to change their appearance when hovered on, create classes in CSS, or use JavaScript to build ciphers.

# Functionality

The pages available:
----------
index.html - Welcome page

design.html - Showcases items

rot13.html - JavaScript ROT13 Cipher

base64.html - JavaScript Base64 Encoder

morse.html - JavaScript Morse Code Encoder
----

JavaScript is used to create the functionality of the cipher pages. Feel free to try them out!
